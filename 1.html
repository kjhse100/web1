        Language) is the dominant markup languagefor web pages,and HTML also provides a way to create 
        structured documentswith links, citations, and other items, as well as to indicate structural meanings 
        for the body, such as titles, paragraphs, and lists. It can also be used to embed images and objects 
        and create interactive forms. HTML is written in the form of an HTML element that is "tagged" 
        surrounded by angle bracketsin the content of a web page. HTML can include or recall scriptssuch as 
        JavaScriptthat affect the behavior of HTML processing devices, such as web browsers,and CSS that 
        define the appearance and placement of the body and other items. W3C,co-director of HTML and CSS 
        standards, recommends the use of CSS for clear and superficial markup.
