    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p><strong>JavaScript</strong>(English: JavaScript)is an object-based script programming language. 
        This language is commonly used within a Web browser and has the ability to access built-in objects
         from other applications. It is also used for server programming, such as runtime environments such 
         as Node.js.JavaScript was originally developed by BrendanEich of Netscape Communications Corporation,
         first named Mocha and later liveScript, and eventually became JavaScript. There are similaritiesbetween
         avaand syntax in Sun Microsystems,but this is actually because both languages are based on the basic
        syntax of the C language,and Java and JavaScript have a weak direct connection. Other than names
        and phrases,there are more similarities to self orscheme than Java. JavaScript is recognized as the
        language that best implements ecmascriptstandards and is supported by default in most browsers 
         until ECMAScript 5 (ES5), but after ECMAScript 6 it is compiled into a transfilerfor browser
