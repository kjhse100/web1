    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p><strong>Dependent sheets</strong> or <strong>cascading style</strong>sheets (CSS)are style sheet languages 
        that describe how markup languagesare actuallydisplayed,[1]and are often used in HTMLand XHTML,and can also
         be used in XML.It is standard in the default filename W3C,and has a high degree of freedom when defining 
         layoutsand styles.

        the default filename[2]is style.css
        
        If the markup language(ex: HTML)is responsible for the body of the website, CSSis responsible for
         decorating it like clothes and accessories. In other words, you can leave the HTML structure intact an
         d make changes to the CSS file to make it look like a completely different website.
        
        For CSS3,which is currently under development,we've added the ability to replace images created by
         graphics editing programs,such as shadow effects, gradients, and transformations. In addition, various
          animation functions have been added to replace Adobe Flashto some extent.
